# compute distances

 These scripts are desinged to get all possible combinations (pairs) of sequences and compute the Levenshtien distance between them. Alternartively, they can be used to construct distance matrices. **WARNING**: Building large distance matrices is extrodinarily resource intensive and the code has not been optimized.
